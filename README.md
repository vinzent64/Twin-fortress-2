# Twin-fortress-2
hello if you are reading this then thank you!
because it means somebody likes this project 
but any ways this is a war paint based on twin peaks and if you dont know twin peaks then still stay here i dont want you going away so yeah
but basicly i made this war paint based off of the scenes when the character agent cooper is having those weird dreams of that little guy that talks backwards
and its just really weird so yeah thats where the consept came from but anyways
hopefully it will be up on the tf2 workshop soon because im doing this from france so yeah but intill now i have to work with what i got so yeah hope you like it
